  "description": "Implementation of earley-intersection, following the notes published by Wilker Aziz in 2017. Earley intersection takes as its parameters (1) a context-free grammar (CFG) and (2) a finite automata (FSA) to produce a CFG. The language of the output grammar is the intersection of the languages of the inputs. The closure property was published by Bar-Hillel in 1961.",
